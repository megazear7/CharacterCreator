Some ideas on what the json could look like for storing data. These are all
just quick notes and quick ideas. Under what is written here we would need the
following collections:

members
characters
items
itemIdentifiers

-------------------------------------------
An idea for how characters could be saved

considerations:
any application pulling data from here will need to take in the stats, and
apply adjustments on needed stats for every level the character has.

current health is not recorded, rather, a max health is given, and then wounds
will need cycled through to find current health.

the idea is that data is not copied to multiple places in the database. in
this way there will be a less likely chance to get bad data. The data is in
one place, and stuff might need added together, or changed around to find
the representation of the data that is desired.

weapons will need some level of encoding. The question is how far do we want
to go with the encoding? An example of how this encoding could work is given:

Example 1:
"<itemName>-<magicalBonus>-<uniqueIdentifier>"
In this way a normal +4 longsword would be: "longsword-4-0"
where the itemName and magicalBonus are self explanetory and uniqueIdentifier
is a code that a application could use to apply special modifications to this
item. Maybe this longsword is a longsword of speed. A application could take
this uniqueIdentifier (which is a number) and then query a seperate table /
collection to figure out what that uniqueIdentifier represents.

we will need a collection for weapons. A weapon could look like the following
in mongo:

{

name: "",
damage: "",
speed: "",
defenseAdjustment: "",
speedAdjustment: "",
size: "",

}

that is meant to be all inclusive, an idividual weapon could have less fields,
two examples are given:

{
name: "longsword",
damage: "2d8p",
speed: "12"
}

{
name: "leatherArmor",
defenseAdjustment: "-3",
speedAdjustment: "+1"
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

under the first given idea for some sort of weapon ecoding we need something
that tells us what the special adjustments mean, we would need a
collection with documents like the following:

{
name: "of speed",
speedAdjustment: "+1"
}

note that there could be all sorts of adjustments, and that name is simply for
display purposes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

some sort of idea for what a member would look like:

{
firstName: "",
lastName: "",
email: "",
characters: {[
	"4f4wt5ww555556gs",
	"dd3wtdfw4fge6gw5",
	"324f4fwfc4wt5553",
]}
}

characters here is just an array of id's, doesn't have to be like this though.
